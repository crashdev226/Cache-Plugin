Cache Plugin
============

Cache Plugin is maintained by [crashdev226](https://github.com/crashdev226), and is strongly based on the [Cache Plugin](https://github.com/php-http/cache-plugin) by the [PHP HTTP Team](http://php-http.org/). This package was created because the original implemenation needed tweaking for my GitHub package, and now I need to share the code with my new GitLab package, thus I have extracted this single class here. Feel free to check out the [releases](https://github.com/crashdev226/Cache-Plugin/releases), [security policy](https://github.com/crashdev226/Cache-Plugin/security/policy), [license](LICENSE), [code of conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and [contribution guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
